# Maktab96_HWs

This repositroy contains most recent and challenging home works that we had to accomplish
during the Maktab Sharif Coding Bootcamp Course.

Each one of them has a different subject and they caused me to face various technical 
challenges which fortunately I was able to solve.

For better understanding of each HW challenges, the problem description of them is attached to their directory
as a PDF file.
